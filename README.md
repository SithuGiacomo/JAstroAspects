# JAstroAspects
#### *Version 0.01 Alpha*
## About

Since there are many astrological software out there especially for vedic astrology, I'm creating this one just as a supplement to those giant ones (like Jagannatha Hora and/or Maitreya).

My goal here is to create an easy-to-use program to get how much angular distance far apart between a planet to another or a planet to a house. And I also wants my program to easily spot if a planet has a relation with another plant(s) or house(s).

For example, if Mars is located in Aries while Mercury is in Cancer and Jupiter in Scorpio, then JAA will print out those relationships of Mars easily.

In JAstroAspects, planets are always front-facing while making aspects. What does it mean? In our previous example, Mars has two aspect relationships with Mercury and Jupiter as 4th and 8th respectively. But that is only true while Mars is travelling in normal mode. If it is travelling in retrograde, then 4th from Mars is Capricorn  and 9th is Virgo. So there will be no relationship of Mars with another planet when it is in retrograde. If one planet is travelling normal and another one is travelling retrograde then the angular distance between those two planets are same. In this regard, Raha and Ketu always make relationships in backward.

The program is still in infancy and currently does nothing. But I'll put more and more features later on.

## Installing

You will need Oracle Java JDK or OpenJDK to compile the program. Compile the main.java and you are good to go.

## License

One of the main reasons to create JAstroAspects is to create an open and free (free as in freespeech) vedic astrological software. Although I like Jagannatha Hora a lot, it is not open source which makes me really itchy. That's why I released this software under Apache License 2.0 so it will remain free and open.

Although I released under Apache License 2.0, let me ask you to kindly release the source if you modify the software. So that the community has chance to improve our work.
